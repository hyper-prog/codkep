This file describes the non fully compatible
changes between the released versions

1.137 -> 1.138
 - Changed the php minimum version from 5.4.0 to 5.6.0.
   There is no any code parts (yet) which requires the higher version, simply
   I don't have any machine (and time, and intention) to test the 5.4.0.

1.115 -> 1.116
 - The SpeedForm::do_validate() function now has an obligatory $mode parameter with 'insert','update','delete' text:
   Definition changed from: do_validate($auto_handle=true) to do_validate($mode,$auto_handle=true)
   You have to specify the desired operation to validate the form/node.
   Search this method in your code and put this first parameter to the function calls.
   (If you miss this you will get an exception)
 - The SpeedForm::generate_form() 's $mode parameter only accepts 'all','select','insert','update','delete'.
   (If you pass different value you will get an exception)
 - Node::getform() default $mode parameter value changed to 'all' from empty because the changes of generate_form() above.
 - Now in SpeedForm data definition array the "in_mode" only works on "type" => "submit" fields.
   (In the old codes it can skip other kind of fields from form generation)
   Use 'skip' => 'exceptinsert' or 'exceptupdate' or 'exceptdelete' instead of in_mode when the field type is not 'submit'.
 - The fields which was "skip" attribute set to "all" or "visual" was skipped in HtmForm's form formatter,
   now they are skipped in SpeedForm's generate_form(). (And the formatter didn't skip the hidden form fields)
   This change can cause different behaviour in some special situation, where you skip some field.

1.109 -> 1.110

 - In SpeedForm class the delete_previous_files() and sql_update_part_CMN() and sql_insert_part_CMN()
   methods was automatic public, now become protected.

1.091 -> 1.092

 - Until now the to_table() function's "headertext" option can be a text or a callback/function name.
   Now the "headertext" option only receive string data. Only the new "headertextcallback" option can be used to specify
   header text data by callback/function name.
   So if the "headertext" option contains a callback, rename is to "headertextcallback".

 - The to_table() function's uses the printed output of "#after" and "#before" callbacks and does not care the returned value.
   Now the returned string value will be used as default, and (as fallback) the printed output is used when empty string returned.
