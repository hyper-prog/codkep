This file describes the non fully compatible
changes between the released versions

1.109 -> 1.110

 - In SpeedForm class the delete_previous_files() and sql_update_part_CMN() and sql_insert_part_CMN()
   methods was automatic public, now become protected.

1.091 -> 1.092

 - Until now the to_table() function's "headertext" option can be a text or a callback/function name.
   Now the "headertext" option only receive string data. Only the new "headertextcallback" option can be used to specify
   header text data by callback/function name.
   So if the "headertext" option contains a callback, rename is to "headertextcallback".

 - The to_table() function's uses the printed output of "#after" and "#before" callbacks and does not care the returned value.
   Now the returned string value will be used as default, and (as fallback) the printed output is used when empty string returned.
